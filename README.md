# Identicon protocol

**Identicon** is a **trustless protocol for identity verification in the OpenWeb**, focused on providing multiple signed verifications of a real world entity and binding it to one (or more) digital identities, and independent of the form these digital identities may take (NFT, DID, etc). It is not an identity vault or a repo for unique identity. 

**Is based on a set of decentralized and random selection of human nodes (citizens) which will produce the “on-site” verification of the solicited identity, proof of life or proof of existence.**

Features:

- Binds trusted real world identity to one (or more) unique digital identities.
- Puts validation in the hands of the people (citizen verification). Anyone can be a validator. 
- Takes validation to the place where people live, not forcing people to move to some central place to prove their identity.
- Simplifies proof of identity requests and validation process on an intuitive and easy to use Dapp.
- Allows recurrent validations (once a week, once a month, etc) to be scheduled and managed by the network.

Opens a whole set of use cases, such as: validating the existence of physical assets, validating providers of goods and services and proving identity and life for validated users on social media platforms.

## Disclaimer

This is a naive and incomplete implementation of some methods of the Verification Contract, produced by the Team#10 (Juan Mescher & Mario Zito) of the *NEAR CERTIFIED DEVELOPER 28-03-2022 course*, and for the sole purpose of completing the required course tasks.

## Concepts

#### What is a *verification* ?

Is the process performed buy a set of human validators with the goal of verifying that a certain person (aka the *Subject*) is who he/she claims to be and is alive.

#### How is the verification done ?

1. Someone (aka the *Requestor*) requests verification of the identity/life/etc of some particular person (aka the *Subject*).

2. A group of persons  (aka the *Validators*) visit the subject in the given address, within a certain *Time Window*.

3. They verify that the subject is alive and is who he/she claims and report it.

4. When all verifications are completed the final state is evaluated based on the verification results.

5. After the verification is completed the validators rewards are payed.

#### What types of verifications are allowed ?

Cases:

- Proof of Life of some human being
- Proof of Identity of some human being
- Proof  of Existence  of a certain asset or service
- Proof of State of a certain asset or service
- Proof of Ownership of a certain asset or service
- Proof of Service that a certain service was completed

#### Who can *request* a verification ?

Anybody who has a NEAR account can request it.

 #### Who will pay for it ?

The requestor must pay for the verification, and it is allways a NEAR account.

#### What is the *subject* ?

The subject is the human being which will be verified.

#### What is a government identification ?

Is the identity document (DNI, Passport, Driver License, etc) issued by some local/national government which provides a unique identification for a given person.

#### Who can be a *validator* ?

Anyone with a NEAR account can act as a validator, but it must be registered in the Dapp.

#### How will they be compensated ?

They will receive 0.5 NEAR per completed verification.

#### What is the *digital passport* ?

It is an NFT (soulbounded and non transferable) generated by the verification protocol which can be used to confirm the verified identity in the Open Web (one/more blockchains).

## Structures

~~~rust

// using "{country}_{type}_{number}", ex: 'ar_dni_12488353'
// compatible with [NEAR DID](https://github.com/ontology-tech/DID-spec-near/blob/master/NEAR/DID-Method-NEAR.md)

## Methods

### Called by *Requestor*

- `request_verification(requestor_id, is_type, subject_id, subject_info)` Registers the new request in the blockchain and assigns validators to verify it.

- `pay_validators(requestor_id, subject_id)`  After reception of all the validators results, we must pay each of the validators the corresponding compensation (0.5 NEAR). Validators which did not complete the verification will not receive payment.

### Called by *Validators*

- `report_verification_result(validator_id, subject_id, result, cause)` Report the result of the verification. If the verification was not possible, or the validator will not do it then  the validator must include a descriptive cause.

- `register_as_validator(validator_id)` The NEAR account owner registers itself as a validator.

### Private

- `assign_validators(self, subject_id) -> Validators` When the request is filled, we must select a number of validators at random from the validators pool, and assign them to the request-

- `evaluate_results(self, results) -> VerificationState`   Every time we receive a verification result we must evaluate if all verifications have been done, and which is the final result for the request. While the verifications are still in course the request state is Pending.

### Not implemented

- `cancel_verification(subject_id, cause)`

- `get_verification_transactions(requestor_id, subject_id)` 

- `get_all_verifications_history(requestor_id, filters)` 

- `mint_digital_passport(requestor_id, subject_id)`  

- `unregister_as_validator(validator_id, self)` 

- `get_my_assigned_verifications(validator_id)` 

- `get_my_verifications_history(validator_id, filters)`
